# GhostBird by Zachary Goniea Spring 2021
This program takes in 2 images, checks if they are the same height and width, and copies the RGB values to a new output file with any differing pixels
removed. As such, in the instance of this program, a bluebird is removed from the images (of course and image file could be inputted).

We utilized a special image filetype called ppm that has RGB (ex 255, 255, 255) values for each individual pixel. Because of this, one can look at and compare the difference
between each pixel and determine if it should stay the same in the output or if one or the other from either image should be copied over.
